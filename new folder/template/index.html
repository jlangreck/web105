                The Ring of fire would be a super cool place to see in real life.
                There are many different rocks to see there and you could even see a
                volcano go off if you were lucky. Half of the adventure would be getting there
                whether by boat or helicoptor it is sure to have a fun time while on your
                way there.

            <h2>Hawii</h2>

            <p>I have always like the idea of living on an island. Besides bad weather sometimes it would be an amzing
                place to visit. My sister went there and said she had the time of her life and even swam with friendly
                sharks.
                Since then I have always had a passion to go there and just soak up the sun and maybe even catch some
                fat fish while I am there.</p>

            <p>The fishing here would be off the charts. I would spend a lot of time
                fishing because I really enojoy doing things like that. I am sure there are many
                fishing cruises you could take and even fishing off shore I would feel had a
                chance to catch the big ones.
