                I have been to Canada once to go fishing and it was very nice there.
                There were trees for miles around at one point and the highway was straight surrounded
                by them. I saw many different animals like moose whichi was kind of scary because those
                things are huge. I also saw a ton of bald eagles which is weird because thats
                America's bird and I saw more there than I had ever seen in my life. I even threw a fish back
                into the water and it was kind of injured so it did not swim right away and this eagle came
                up to him and snagged him from the surface of the water.

            <h2>Canada</h2>

            <p>I went with my granda last time and we drove there. It was a very long car ride
                filled with his terriable music choices of mainly country and old timie stuff.
                I remember every couple hours or so my bottom would start killing me from just sitting
                in one spot the whole ride and I had to keep trying to strech my legs and back every chance I got.
                Going through the border was not as bad as I thought and we got threw in record time
                according to my grandpa.
