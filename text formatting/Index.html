        <h1>Turok 2 review</h1>
        <h2>summary</h2>
        <p><Strong>Turok 2 Seeds Of Evil</Strong>is an Nintendo 64 game made by <em>Akklaim studios</em> This
            game has always been one of my favorites games for many reasons. I could go on about the amazing weapons
            you get throughout your adventure or the aray of enemies in your path, but I think this games shines most
            for how hard is it and the perfect soundtrack.</p>
        <p>The main character is an indian named Jousha Fireseed who is summoned by an alien named Adon. She tells you
            world is going to end if you don't stop the Primeagon who is the main antagonist. You go out many different
            setting and worlds to collect primeagon keys to unlock the last level and defend energy beacons located in
            each
            level. Each level also has its own objectives that must be complete or else you will fail to beat the level
            adventure
            this game shows no mercy and will make you restart the whole thing.
        </p>
        <p>The controlls feel very smooth for a game made in 1998 and the music in this game is dead on for what ever
            level
            you are on. The very first level drops you in a rundown taken over city and the song the plays is so catchy
            yet
            sounds almost frighting which gives you an erie feeling that gets your heart racing. I used to just sit on
            the
            pause screen and just listen to the song, thats how good it is. The enemies are mostley dinosoid mutants who
            can and will take 30 percent of your health very quick if you are not paying attention. The enemies are well
            placed throughout each level and each level is almost maze like with backtracking and worse of all no
            composs or
            anything telling you which way to go.
        </p>

        Turok 2</h2>
        <p>This game has the coolest variety of weapons I think I have ever seen in a video game. You start off with the
            basics like a pistol and bow. As you go throughout your adventure you will find better and even more fun
            guns to use.
            My personal favorite is a circular blade which spins and then is thrown like a frisbee into enemies and
            somehow catches
            it on the return like a boomerang.
        </p>
        <p>There are many other crazier and stronger weapons like a missle launcher with triple rockets in it. The most
            imfamous weapon in this game is the weapon called the cerboral bore. This locks onto only intelligent
            creatures
            and will drill into their head and then explode. To this day I have not seen anything as cool or as
            rememberable as this.

        <h3>Quote</h3>
        <p>Whenever you collect enough life tokkens scattered throughout the level your character will say <q>I am
                Turok</q>and
            sounds funny which is why it is so rememberable.
